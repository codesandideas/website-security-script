## 📋 Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux/Unix-based system
- **Bash**: Version 4.0 or higher
- **Root Access**: Required (`sudo`) for comprehensive file system scanning
- **Optional Tools**:
  - `curl` - For webhook integration
  - `python` or `python3` - For JSON payload formatting (webhook feature)
  - `php` - For PHP configuration analysis
  - `node` - For Node.js runtime analysis

## 🚀 Installation

### Quick Install (Global Command)

```bash
sudo bash install.sh
```

This installs the scanner as `webscan` in `/usr/local/bin` and creates a default config file at `~/.config/webscan/config`.

### Manual

```bash
chmod +x website-security-script.sh
sudo bash website-security-script.sh /path/to/website
```

### Uninstall

```bash
sudo bash uninstall.sh
```

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Scan

```bash
webscan /var/www/html
```

### Background Scan

Run a scan that continues even after closing the terminal:

```bash
webscan /var/www/html --background
```

Output is logged to `~/.config/webscan/logs/scan_<timestamp>.log`. Monitor with:

```bash
tail -f ~/.config/webscan/logs/scan_*.log
```

### Scheduled Scans (Cron)

Set up recurring scans using shortcuts or custom cron expressions:

```bash
# Built-in shortcuts
webscan /var/www/html --cron hourly        # Every hour
webscan /var/www/html --cron daily         # Every day at 2 AM
webscan /var/www/html --cron weekly        # Every Sunday at 2 AM
webscan /var/www/html --cron monthly       # 1st of each month at 2 AM

# Custom cron expression
webscan /var/www/html --cron '30 3 * * 1-5'   # Weekdays at 3:30 AM

# With email notification
webscan /var/www/html --cron daily --email admin@example.com
```

Manage cron jobs:

```bash
webscan --list-cron      # Show active webscan cron jobs
webscan --remove-cron    # Remove all webscan cron jobs
```

### Scan with Webhook Notification

```bash
webscan /var/www/html \
  --webhook https://yourdomain.com/security-receiver.php \
  --api-key YOUR_SECRET_KEY \
  --email admin@example.com
```

  --help                    Show this help message
```

### Configuration

The scanner stores persistent settings in `~/.config/webscan/config` and a global path exclusion list in `~/.config/webscan/allowlist`. Set defaults so you don't have to pass options every time:

```bash
webscan --set-email admin@example.com    # Save default email
webscan --enable-email                   # Enable email notifications
webscan --set-webhook https://...        # Save default webhook URL
webscan --set-api-key YOUR_KEY           # Save default API key
webscan --show-config                    # View current configuration
webscan --edit-config                    # Open config in your editor
```

Override any saved default on a per-scan basis:

```bash
webscan /path --email other@mail.com     # Use a different email for this scan
webscan /path --no-email                 # Skip email for this scan
```

## 🚫 Excluding Paths

The scanner supports path exclusions at two levels: a per-project dotfile and a global allowlist file.

### `.scanignore` — project-level exclusions

Place a `.scanignore` file in the root of the directory you are scanning. One pattern per line; `#` starts a comment. The `*` wildcard is supported.

```
# .scanignore — place in your website root
vendor/
node_modules/
storage/framework/
wp-content/uploads/
tests/
wp-content/themes/my-theme/assets/js/vendor.*   # glob * supported
```

The scanner checks for `.scanignore` in the scan root first. If none is found it falls back to `~/.config/webscan/allowlist` for site-wide defaults.

### `~/.config/webscan/allowlist` — global exclusions

Any paths or patterns listed here are excluded from every scan that does not have its own `.scanignore`.

### `--no-allowlist` — disable all exclusions

To run a scan with no exclusions at all (including the built-in WordPress and Laravel core filters):

```bash
webscan /var/www/html --no-allowlist
```

### Built-in exclusions

Even without a `.scanignore` the scanner automatically suppresses noise from:

- **WordPress**: verified core files (`wp-admin/`, `wp-includes/`) matched against official checksums, with a path-based fallback when offline
- **Laravel**: known boilerplate paths (`bootstrap/`, `routes/`, `storage/framework/`, etc.)

---

## 🔍 Scan Categories

The scanner performs the following security checks:

### 1. **Malware Detection**
- Known web shells (c99, r57, b374k, WSO, etc.)
- PHP backdoor functions (eval, base64_decode, gzinflate, etc.)
- Python reverse shells and backdoors
- Node.js command injection patterns
- Malicious iframes and script injections
- Cryptocurrency miners (Coinhive, CryptoLoot, etc.)
- SEO spam and pharma hack patterns

### 2. **File & Code Analysis**
- Executable files in upload/media directories
- Suspicious filenames (shell.php, backdoor.php, etc.)
- Polyglot files (PHP code hidden in images)
- Obfuscated code (large single-line files)
- SQL injection patterns
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) patterns
- Suspicious base64/hex encoding
- PHP obfuscation techniques

### 3. **File System Security**
- Recently created executable files (last 7 days)
- Suspicious symlinks pointing outside web root
- World-writable files and directories
- SUID/SGID files
- Files owned by suspicious users

### 4. **Framework-Specific Audits**

Each detected framework receives targeted security checks:

- **WordPress**: Version check, debug mode, file editor, security keys, SSL enforcement, XML-RPC, plugin/theme vulnerabilities
- **Laravel**: Debug mode, environment settings, APP_KEY, database configuration, CSRF protection, log files
- **Drupal**: Core integrity, configuration security
- **Django**: DEBUG setting, SECRET_KEY, allowed hosts, database security
- **Flask**: Debug mode, secret key configuration
- **Node.js**: Package vulnerabilities, security headers

### 5. **Dependency Scanning**
- npm packages (Node.js)
- Composer packages (PHP)
- pip packages (Python)
- Bundler gems (Ruby)

### 6. **Runtime Configuration**
- PHP configuration (display_errors, file_uploads, open_basedir)
- Node.js runtime security
- Database connection security

### 7. **Server Environment**
- Kernel and OS information
- Running processes analysis
- Port scanning (listening services)

### 8. **Security Score & Grade**

After scanning, the tool calculates a security score (0–100) and assigns a letter grade:

| Grade | Score Range | Meaning |
|-------|------------|---------|
| A+    | 95–100     | Excellent security posture |
| A     | 90–94      | Very good |
| B     | 80–89      | Good, minor issues |
| C     | 70–79      | Fair, notable issues |
| D     | 60–69      | Poor, significant issues |
| F     | 0–59       | Critical, immediate action needed |

## 📤 Webhook Integration

The scanner can POST scan results to a remote webhook endpoint in JSON format:

### Webhook Payload Structure

```json
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "hostname": "webserver01",
  "scan_target": "/var/www/html",
  "frameworks": "WordPress, Laravel",
  "risk_level": "🔴 Critical Risk",
  "security_grade": "D",
  "security_score": 62,
  "total_issues": 42,
  "critical": 5,
  "high": 12,
  "medium": 15,
  "low": 8,
  "info": 2,
  "report": "# Security Scan Report\n..."
}
```

### Webhook Requirements

- Endpoint must accept POST requests
- Content-Type: `application/json`
- Must return HTTP 200 for successful receipt
- Timeout: 30 seconds

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Running the Scanner

- **Always backup your data** before running security scans
- Run on a test/staging environment first
- Review findings carefully - false positives are possible
- The scanner is read-only and does not modify files
- Requires root access to scan all files and processes

### Webhook Security

- Use HTTPS endpoints only for webhook URLs
- Implement strong API key validation on the receiving end
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Sanitize and validate all webhook data before processing
- Consider IP whitelisting for webhook endpoints

### Report Handling

- Security reports contain sensitive information
- Store reports securely with appropriate permissions
- Delete old reports or archive them encrypted
- Do not commit reports to version control
- Review who has access to report files
